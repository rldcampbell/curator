- Use Poppins font?
- Make special meta properties e.g. to style cards (colour?)
  - Make it possible for meta properties to reference actual properties?!
  - Maybe these could be special fields with fixed ids that are either toggled on or off.
  - Add default values for a collection when defining a collection?
  - Allow standard properties to have default values too...
